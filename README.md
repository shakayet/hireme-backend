## ðŸ”— API Endpoints

###  Auth

* `POST /api/auth/register`
* `POST /api/auth/login`

###  Admin (Protected: `admin`)

* `GET /api/admin/users`
* `GET /api/admin/jobs`
* `GET /api/admin/applications`

### Employee (Protected: `employee`)

* `POST /api/jobs` - Create job
* `GET /api/recruiter/applications` - View applications to own jobs
* `PATCH /api/recruiter/applications/:appId` - Accept/Reject application

### Job Seeker (Protected: `seeker`)

* `GET /api/jobs` - View jobs
* `POST /api/applications/apply` - Apply with CV + payment
* `GET /api/seeker/applications` - View application history

---

### Input Validation

We use [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for runtime input validation on all key endpoints including:

- User registration and login  
- Job creation by employees  
- Job application by seekers

This ensures data correctness and helpful error messages for invalid inputs.

---

### Constants & Enums

To improve code readability, maintainability, and avoid hardcoded values, all user roles and application statuses are managed via centralized constants:

- `ROLES` â€” defines valid user roles: `admin`, `employee`, `seeker`
- `APPLICATION_STATUS` â€” tracks job application status: `pending`, `accepted`, `rejected`
- `PAYMENT_STATUS` â€” tracks payment state: `paid`, `pending`

These constants are defined in `src/constants/index.js` and used across:
- Mongoose schema enums
- Role-based access middleware
- Controllers (status assignments and checks)
- Zod input validation schemas

---

## File Upload

* Only `.pdf` and `.docx` allowed
* Max size: 5MB
* Uses Multer with disk storage in `/uploads`

---

## Payment Logic

* Simulated payment
* Automatically marked as `paid`
* Invoice is saved per application (100 Taka)
